    "## Motivation: important relation between array observation and wave propagation\n",
    "\n",
    "In day 2 you may have noticed from the epicentral infrasound that the back azimuth does not directly point towards the epicentre. Hence, the array does not always point towards the source! Or does it?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the atmosphere, propagation effects between source and receiver can alter the path. As such, the array will not always point towards the source. If you know where the source is located, you can use this slowness offset as a method to probe the medium!\n",
    "\n",
    "A 5 min introduction on wave propagation in the atmosphere: [how does infrasound propagate and what do we expect at the array?](arrays_and_propagation.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "This figure illustrates the propagation effect of cross-winds altering the back azimuth of the plane wave. As sound propagates, it drifts sideways due to the cross-wind in the stratosphere. In order to construct a path from the source, the volcano, to the array the signal needs to start slightly in the wind and not directing towards the array. Next, the sound drifts along the path and arrives at the array with the starting angle. As such, the back azimuth angle does not direct towards the source.\n",
    "![relation.png](images/relation.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The atmosphere is a moving medium, where mainly winds has a very strong effect on how sound propagations and what we can or do observe at the array. The solid earth and ocean are static, however, other phenomena and situations can and will have a significant impact on your array observations. \n",
    "Seismic arrays are for example very senstive to variations in the [geology](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/ssa/bssa/article/89/4/989/102851/teleseismic-slowness-azimuth-station-corrections) affects the array sensitivity, while underwater bathymetric blocking, scattering and reflections cause difficulties in what you detect.\n",
    "Therefore, the combination of wave propagation and array processing is crucial in a consize analysis of your signal of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What infrasound apparent velocities do we expect?\n",
    "Retrieved apparent velocities are not random. As explained in day 1, the slowest apparent velocity equals the local speed of sound of a horizontally propagating signal. The fastest apparent velocity (inclined waves) of farfield signals is constrained by the velocity profile in the atmosphere.\n",

Infrasound signals are detected on the IMS infrasound arrays of the CTBT: a) IS45 in Russia and b) IS30 in Japan. Since the source is underground, seismic signals couple to the atmosphere but do not producing very high SNR signals.

    "Standing ocean surface waves radiate acoustic energy at twice the ocean surface frequency in the ocean and atmosphere (known as microbaroms) and coupling through the water column with the solid seafloor (known as secondary microseisms). In the solid earth, the interaction of the individual surface waves with the bathymetry also generates small pressure fluctuations at the ocean surface wave frequency (known as primary microseisms).\n",
    "\n",
    "Most energetic ocean surface waves are wind waves with a typical period of 10 seconds. Ocean surface waves excited by wind can stay in motion for a long time. Excited ocean surface without the wind forcing is known as swell. Interacting patches of swell-swell of wind waves and swell generate most of the microbarom/microseism signals. In addition, wind waves and swell near the coast reflect from steep walls generating standing waves as well. Near-coastal microseisms produce higher frequency signals due to the shallower depth.\n",
